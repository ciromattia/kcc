# KCC

`KCC` (a.k.a. `KindleComicConverter`) is a Python app to convert comic files or folders to ePub or Panel View MOBI.  
It was initally developed for Kindle but since v2.2 it outputs valid ePub 2.0 so _**despite its name, KCC is
actually a comic 2 epub converter that every ereader owner can happily use**_.  

It can also optionally optimize images by applying a number of transformations.

## BINARY RELEASES

- Linux: Just download sourcecode and launch `python kcc.py` *(Provided you have Python and Pillow installed)*

## INPUT FORMATS
`kcc` can understand and convert, at the moment, the following file types:
- PNG, JPG, GIF, TIFF, BMP
- Folders
- CBZ, ZIP
- CBR, RAR *(With `unrar` executable)*
- PDF *(Extracting only contained JPG images)*

## OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- `kindlegen` v2.7+ in a directory reachable by your PATH or in KCC directory *(For .mobi generation)*
- [unrar](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) *(For CBR support)*

### For compiling/running from source:
- Python 2.7+ (Included in MacOS and Linux, follow the [official documentation](http://www.python.org/getit/windows/) to install on Windows)
- [Pillow](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/) for comic optimizations like split double pages, resize to optimal resolution, improve contrast and palette, etc.
  Please refer to official documentation for installing into your system.

## USAGE

### GUI

Should be pretty self-explanatory, just keep in mind that it's still in development ;)
While working it seems frozen, I'll try to fix the aesthetics later.
Conversion being done, you should find an .epub and a .mobi files alongside the original input file (same directory)

### Standalone `comic2ebook.py` usage:
