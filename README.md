# KCC

**Kindle Comic Converter** is a Python app to convert comic/manga files or folders to EPUB, Panel View MOBI or E-Ink optimized CBZ.
It was initially developed for Kindle but since version 4.6 it outputs valid EPUB 3.0 so _**despite its name, KCC is
actually a comic/manga to EPUB converter that every e-reader owner can happily use**_.
It can also optionally optimize images by applying a number of transformations.

### A word of warning
**KCC** _is not_ [Amazon's Kindle Comic Creator](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1001103761) nor is in any way endorsed by Amazon.  
Amazon's tool is for comic publishers and involves a lot of manual effort, while **KCC** is for comic/manga readers.
_KC2_ in no way is a replacement for **KCC** so you can be quite confident we'll going to carry on developing our little monster ;-)

## DEPENDENCIES
Following software is required to run Linux version of **KCC** and/or bare sources:
- Python 3.3+
- [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download5) 5.2.1+ _(5.5+ is recommended)_
- [Pillow](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/) 3.0.0+
- [psutil](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil) 3.2.1+
- [python-slugify](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-slugify) 1.1.4+
- [scandir](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scandir) 1.1.0+ _(needed only when using Python 3.3 or 3.4)_

On Debian based distributions these two commands should install all needed dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-pip python3-pyqt5 libpng-dev libjpeg-dev p7zip-full unrar
sudo pip3 install --upgrade pillow python-slugify psutil scandir
```

### Optional dependencies
- [KindleGen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211) v2.9+ in a directory reachable by your _PATH_ or in _KCC_ directory *(For MOBI generation)*
- [UnRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) *(For CBR/RAR support)*
- [7za](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) *(For 7z/CB7 support)*

## INPUT FORMATS
**KCC** can understand and convert, at the moment, the following input types:
- Folders containing: PNG, JPG or GIF files
- CBZ, ZIP
- CBR, RAR *(With `unrar` executable)*
- CB7, 7Z *(With `7za` executable)*
- PDF *(Only extracting JPG images)*

## USAGE

Should be pretty self-explanatory. All options have detailed informations in tooltips.
After completed conversion you should find ready file alongside the original input file (same directory).

Please check [our wiki](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/wiki/) for more details.

CLI version of **KCC** is intended for power users. It is not idiot-proof like GUI :-)
