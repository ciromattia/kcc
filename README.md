# KCC

**KindleComicConverter** is a Python app to convert comic files or folders to ePub or Panel View MOBI.
It was initally developed for Kindle but since v2.2 it outputs valid ePub 2.0 so _**despite its name, KCC is
actually a comic to EPUB converter that every e-reader owner can happily use**_.
It can also optionally optimize images by applying a number of transformations.

### A word of warning
**KCC** _is not_ [Amazon's Kindle Comic Creator](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1001103761) nor is in any way endorsed by Amazon.  
Amazon's tool is for comic publishers and involves a lot of manual effort, while **KCC** is for comic readers.
If you want to read some comments over *Amazon's KC2* you can take a look at [this](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=207461&page=7#96) and [that](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=211047) threads on Mobileread.
_KC2_ in no way is a replacement for **KCC** so you can be quite confident we'll going to carry on developing our little monster ;)

_It has been reported by a couple of users that version 2.10 crashing on OSX at start. We don't know if that issue still exist in version 3.0.
If it happens to you please append your message to [Issue #52](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/issues/52)._

## INPUT FORMATS
**KCC** can understand and convert, at the moment, the following file types:
- PNG, JPG, GIF, TIFF, BMP
- Folders
- CBZ, ZIP
- CBR, RAR *(With `unrar` executable)*
- PDF *(Extracting only contained JPG images)*

## OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- [KindleGen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211) v2.9+ in a directory reachable by your _PATH_ or in _KCC_ directory *(For .mobi generation)*
- [UnRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) *(For CBR/RAR support)*

### For compiling/running from source:
- Python 2.7 - Included in MacOS and Linux, follow the [official documentation](http://www.python.org/getit/windows/) to install on Windows.
- PyQt4 - Please refer to official documentation for installing into your system.
- [Pillow](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/) - For comic optimizations. Please refer to official documentation for installing into your system.

## USAGE

### Important tips:
* Use high quality source files. **This little detail have a major impact on the final result.**
* Read tooltip of _High/Ultra quality_ option. There are many important informations there.
* When converting images smaller than device resolution remember to enable upscaling.
* Check our [wiki](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/wiki/Other-devices) for a list of tested Non-Kindle E-Readers.
* The first image found will be set as the comic's cover.
* All files/directories will be added to EPUB in alphabetical order.
* Output MOBI file should be uploaded via USB. Other methods (e.g. via Calibre) might corrupt it.
* If you're converting color images and the end result is not satisfactory, experiment with gamma correction option (check 1.0 setting first).

### GUI 

Should be pretty self-explanatory.
After completed conversion you should find ready file alongside the original input file (same directory).

### Standalone `comic2ebook.py` usage:
