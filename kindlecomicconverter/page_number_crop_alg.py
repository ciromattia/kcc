Some assupmptions on the page number sizes
We assume that the size of the number (including all digits) is between
'min_shape_size_tolerated_size' and 'max_shape_size_tolerated_size' relative to the image size.
We assume the distance between the digit is no more than 'max_dist_size' (x,y), and no more than 3 digits.
'''
max_shape_size_tolerated_size = (0.015*3, 0.02) # percent
min_shape_size_tolerated_size = (0.003, 0.006)  # percent
window_h_size = max_shape_size_tolerated_size[1]*1.25 # percent
max_dist_size = (0.01, 0.002) # percent


'''
E-reader screen real-estate is an important resource.
More available screensize means more details can be better seen, especially text.
Text is one of the most important elements that need to be clearly readable on e-readers,
which mostly are smaller devices where the need to zoom is unwanted.

By cropping the page number on the bottom of the page, 2%-5% of the page height can be regained
that allows us to upscale the image even more.
- Most of the times the screen height is the limiting factor in upscaling, rather than its width.

    Parameters:
            img (PIL image): A PIL image.
            power (float): The power to 'chop' through pixels matching the background. Values in range[0,3].
            background_color (string): 'white' for white background, anything else for black.
    Returns:
            bbox (4-tuple, left|top|right|bot): The tightest bounding box calculated after trying to remove the bottom page number. Returns None if couldnt find anything satisfactory
